version 4.0.4
description  Textpattern.
detail Textpattern grew out of the system used to publish Textismthe personal site of Dean Allenand was made available to testers in alpha versions as early as 2001. The early alpha versions were followed by a series of beta releases which saw more widespread use, and which were themselves superseded by a series of "gamma" releases which expanded and refined Textpattern's capabilities. Originally some concern existed regarding licensing, but since the gamma version numbered 1.19 (released June 7, 2004), Textpattern has been distributed under the GNU GPL.<br>In addition to being the first GPL version of Textpattern, gamma 1.19 was the final gamma release; the next version, in September of 2004, was Release Candidate 1 for Textpattern 1.0. In a somewhat unorthodox move, Textpattern continued to accumulate features as the second, third, fourth and fifth release candidates were made public. During this time the official development team, originally consisting solely of Dean Allen, expanded to include several talented contributors from the nascent Textpattern community: with Release Candidate 3 Alex Shiels and Pedro Palazón joined the development team, and Sencer Yurdagül was brought into the fold as Textpattern's release manager with Release Candidate 4.<br>The fifth release candidate, however, included a notice that no new features would be added before the 1.0 release, and two weeks later, on August 14, 2005, the first officially stable version of Textpattern was released. Due to the extended development processmany of the previous releases, even before the 1.0 candidates, were widely considered stable and mature enough for production usethis release was named "Textpattern 4.0" rather than "Textpattern 1.0".
