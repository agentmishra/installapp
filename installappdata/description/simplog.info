description Simplog.
detail Simplog is open source, meaning that you can use and distribute it as you'd like as long as you don't change it. Simplog was created to provide people with an easy way to create and maintain their own personal or a community weblog.  With the increasing number of people creating on-line journals, there is a need for a tool that allows them a quick and easy way to share their lives with the rest of the world.
