detail  phpCMS is more than just a content management system: it is also a templating engine and an application framework.<br>phpCMS simplifies many tasks for maintaining complex web sites. phpCMS automatically updates the sitemap, has central administration of menus, and has a comprehensive full-text search. It simply and powerfully separates site layout from site content. This leaves the webmaster free to focus on perfecting the site, instead of wrestling with its coding.
