detail The PHP Spam Poison is a fake-page generator that simulates long lists of fake email addresses and links to more fake generated pages. So, when spam-robots (spam spiders) try to harvest email addresses from your website, they get hundreds or thousands of fake email addresses, effectively poisoning their databases with useless data.
