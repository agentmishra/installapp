description  Blosxom.
detail Blosxom (pronounced like "blossom") is an Open Source weblogging tool respective simple content management system, initially written by Rael Dornfest and now maintained by a group of developers around the Blosxom Yahoo! Group [1] and The Unofficial Blosxom User Group [2].<br>The design of Blosxom is quite minimalist. The entirety of Blosxom is distributed as a single Perl script. All configuration is done by editing this script. All of the weblog entries are stored as normal plain text files, consisting of a headline, optional headers or meta-information (if using certain plugins), and a blank line followed by the post body. New display styles can be added by creating template files called flavours. Blosxom can operate as a CGI script or produce static HTML files. By default, Blosxom supports showing recent posts, doing content categorization, content retrieval by date (and permalinking based on that), and RSS feeds.<br>Blosxom and many of its derivatives are very popular among people who want to write weblog postings with their favourite text editor instead of using a web-based interface. Nevertheless, there exist plugins for web-based posting to a blosxom weblog, too.<br>Despite its simplicity, Blosxom is versatile and can be extended with dozens of available plugins.
