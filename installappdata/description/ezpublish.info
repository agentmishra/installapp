description  EZ publish.
detail eZ Publish is an open source enterprise content management system. It is developed by the Norwegian company eZ Systems and a growing number of users and developers worldwide. eZ Publish is available for free download under the GPL licence, as well as under proprietary licences with commercial support. eZ Publish aims to support the development of professional web applications in PHP. The name eZ Publish is pronounced as "easy publish".<br>The eZ Publish functional range targets the quick, professional and secure realization of web applications. Functional criteria are (besides standards such as sitemaps, search and printing function):<br>* a logic for content versioning;<br>* a media library; and<br>* role-based rights management.<br>Furthermore, custom changes can be made to eZ Publish. For this, the system's architecture provides "Extensions", which are meant to contain individual functions. This allows for the upgrading of the kernel even after customizing new versions. Finally, there are several hundred contributions provided by the community. eZ Systems integrates such contributions into the kernel on a continuous basis. This is done especially to avoid mixed installations of the kernel and custom plugins, which could lead to serious problems (e.g. for migrating an existing installation to new versions of PHP, as such plugins are usually supported unpredictably).
