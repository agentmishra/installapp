version 1.1.2
description  Xaraya.
detail Xaraya is a web application framework and content management system, written in PHP and released as free software under the GNU General Public License. It was originally a fork of the original 0.8 development branch of Postnuke, but has been re-written from the ground up since then.<br>According to an official press release blurb by the Xaraya developers, the main advantages of Xaraya are the following:<br>* A modular architecture, which prevents developers from having to modify the core system directly in order to achieve a certain functionality.<br>* A lot of re-usable code, such as a globally usable comments system, or a global categories system.<br>* Presentation is controlled entirely by templates and themes; no part of the layout is hardcoded.<br>* With Xaraya's Dynamic Data Model, you are able to redesign the data structure of modules. Need to capture different user data? Dynamic Data can do that for you, and you can export the data structure to other websites in need.<br>* Support for different article types (such as News, Documents, Links, Reviews, FAQ, etc.), and the possibility to easily add new article types from the administration area.<br>* Modular authentication, allowing Xaraya to support authentication methods such as LDAP, PAM. A working LDAP module is shipped by default with Xaraya, and new plugin systems are being developed.<br>* A unique administration system, which is meant to allow for quick navigation to make administration tasks as efficient for the user as possible.<br>* An installer which simplifies the process of setting up Xaraya.<br>* An advanced permissions system.<br>* Built in short URL support in many modules.<br>* Template and output caching.
