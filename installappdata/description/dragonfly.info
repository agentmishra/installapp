description  Dragonfly CMS.
detail Dragonfly CMS is an open source content management system (CMS) written in PHP and powered by either MySQL or PostgreSQL. Dragonfly was originally based on PHP-Nuke 6.5[1]. It was a very basic CMS, only including Coppermine and several optimizations or rewrites. Previously it was named CPG-Nuke, "CPG" coming from Coppermine Photo Gallery, and "Nuke" from PHP-Nuke. The development team has spent over two years on it, paying close attention to security, reliability, and features. It still contains PHP-Nuke's basic ideas, but extending it by adding cache support, a new theme system, a complete core rewrite, and several other features.<br>* 10× speed increase compared to PHP-Nuke[citation needed]<br>* 30% reduction in base code<br>* MMCache and eAccelerator control support (if installed on server)<br>* Site-wide cache-based template and configuration system<br>* Uses 50% fewer database queries than most PHP-Nuke derivatives<br>* Advanced database query (verbose) debugging<br>* MySQL 4.x or 5.x, and PostgreSQL 7.3.x+ experimental support<br>* Advanced i18n language system<br>Included Modules<br>* Contactfeedback form for easy contacting of the site administrator<br>* coppermineCoppermine Photo Gallery, photo gallery<br>* Forumsbased on phpBB, but includes several enhancements<br>* Groupsgroup administration, similar to phpBB's<br>* Member List<br>* Newseasy to use news, generally used as the home module on most sites<br>* Sponsorsbanner ad administration<br>* Private Messagesallows messaging between site members<br>* Search<br>* Statisticsadvanced site stats, tracks browsers, search bots, etc.<br>* Surveyspolling<br>* Tell a Friendusers can refer your site to someone else
